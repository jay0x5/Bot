A modified Sequential and NLP based Bot
I improvised this bot a bit with some implementations as a part of my own hobby project :)
Note: I do not own this code entirely and It belongs to NeuralNine, make sure to checkout his: 
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/NeuralNine &
Github: https://github.com/NeuralNine?tab=repositories

If anyone is interested in knowing more about this project and my implementations about this project then feel free to contact me!
heres my mail: contactjay0x5@gmail.com

IMPORTANT: also, the implementation is still not entirely done, i am still tweaking it so dont brag after running an incomplete code ;)

Feel free to contribute by doing a pull request and proper contributed code explanation :D



Implementations I did:
1. Added a speak and voice input function (easiest thing)
2. Wrote an algorithm so it can differentiate between a normal command and a command asking him to perform a specific action 


i am still improvising my implementations to make the behaviour more subtle and less weird
